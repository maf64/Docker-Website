    <h3 style="color: white">Virtualization</h3>
    <h4 style="color: white">Definition</h4>
    <p style="color: white; margin-top: 1cm>">In computing, virtualization or virtualisation is the act of creating a
        virtual version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer
        network resources.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4 style="color: white">Example</h4>
    <p style="color: white">Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that
        are traditionally bound to hardware.It allows you to use a physical machine’s full capacity by
        distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.

        In more practical terms, imagine you have 3 physical servers with individual dedicated purposes. One is a
        mail server, another is a web server, and the last one runs internal legacy applications. Each server is being
        used at about 30% capacity—just a fraction of their running potential. But since the legacy apps remain
        important
        to your internal operations, you have to keep them and the third server that hosts them, right?</p>
    <img src="server.jpg" alt="server" width=500 height="180">
    <p style="color: white">Traditionally, yes. It was often easier and more reliable to run individual tasks on
        individual servers: 1 server, 1 operating system, 1 task. It wasn’t easy to give 1 server multiple brains. But
        with virtualization, you can split the mail server into 2 unique ones that can handle independent tasks so the
        legacy apps can be migrated. It’s the same hardware, you’re just using more of it more efficiently.</p>
    <img src="server2.jpg" alt="server2" width=500 height="180">
    <p style="color: white">Keeping security in mind, you could split the first server again so it could handle another
        task—increasing its use from 30%, to 60%, to 90%. Once you do that, the now empty servers could be reused for
        other tasks or retired altogether to reduce cooling and maintenance costs.</p>
    <h3 style="color: white">How does Virtualization work?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="color: white">Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual
        environments—the things that need those resources. Hypervisors can sit on top of an operating system (like on a
        laptop) or be installed directly onto hardware (like a server), which is how most enterprises virtualize.
        Hypervisors take your physical resources and divide them up so that virtual environments can use them.
        \Resources are partitioned as needed from the physical environment to the many virtual environments. Users
        interact with and run computations within the virtual environment (typically called a guest machine or virtual
        machine). The virtual machine functions as a single data file. And like any digital file, it can be moved from
        one computer to another, opened in either one, and be expected to work the same. When the virtual environment is
        running and a user or program issues an instruction that requires additional resources from the physical
        environment, the hypervisor relays the request to the physical system and caches the changes—which all happens
        at close to native speed (particularly if the request is sent through an open source hypervisor based on KVM,
        the Kernel-based Virtual Machine).
