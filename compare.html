    <h3 style="color: white">Comparison</h3>
    <p style="color: white; margin-top: 1cm>">Virtualization enables you to run multiple operating systems on the
        hardware of a single physical server, while containerization enables you to deploy multiple applications using
        the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server.<br>
        <br> Virtual machines are great for supporting applications that require an operating system’s full
        functionality when you want to deploy multiple applications on a server, or when you have a wide variety of
        operating systems to manage. Containers are a better choice when your biggest priority is to minimize the number
        of servers you’re using for multiple applications.<br>
        <br>Containers are an excellent choice for tasks with a much shorter lifecycle. With their fast set up time,
        they are suitable for tasks that may only take a few hours. Virtual machines have a longer lifecycle than
        containers, and are best used for longer periods of time.<br></p>

    <h3 style="color: white">Benefits of Containerization</h3>
    <p style="color: white">One of the key benefits of containerization is that you can often pack many more containers
        on a host machine than you can on virtual machines. That stands to reason, because each VM is a self-contained
        system in its own right, with its own operating system and virtualized hardware and its own unique resources
        allocated to it. If each VM is 10Gb in size, then 10 VMs will take up 10×10 = 100Gb of resources.

        But take a 10Gb container and run ten of them, or even a hundred, and you won’t use anything close to 100Gb of
        resources. That’s due to all the sharing that’s occurring.

        In effect, there’s only one operating system (strictly speaking one kernel) shared by all the containers. And
        there’s no virtualized hardware — just a little application and operating environment in a container. And that
        means you can run far more containers on a host than you could possibly run fully-blown virtual machines.

        There’s an add-on effect of sharing the kernel and other resources as well, and it’s that containers can
        start-up in less than a second. That’s not the case with VMs, which require a full virtual system boot and can
        take substantially longer to get going.

        You can run Docker containers on AWS and Azure public clouds, for example, and containers are easy to share.
        That’s particularly useful for test and dev teams — one of the most commonly cited potential beneficiaries of
        Docker.</p>

    <h3 style="color: white">Benefits of Virtualization</h3>
    <p style="color: white">Visually, each virtual machine image looks like a data folder. Each can be moved and copied
        as easily as you can move and copy other kinds of files. In this way, your team can centralize workloads and run several different
        operating systems without increasing overhead, a huge advantage over on-premises hardware. You can also update
        apps and the OS without affecting the end-user experience.<br>

        <br>However, virtual machines are not without their disadvantages:<br>
        - Since each VM includes an OS and a virtual copy of all the hardware the OS requires, VMs require significant RAM
        and CPU resources <br>

        - Due to the increase in virtual copies and required resources, the software development life cycle is more
        complex with VMs<br>

        - Moving VMs between public clouds, private clouds and traditional data centers can be challenging</p>
