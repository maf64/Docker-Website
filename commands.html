    <h3 style="color: white">Linux Commands</h3>
    <p style="color: white; margin-top: 1cm>">1. pwd - When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory
        of your user. To know which directory you are in, you can use the “pwd” command. It gives us the absolute path,
        which means the path that starts from the root. The root is the base of the Linux file system. It is denoted by
        a forward slash( / ). The user directory is usually something like "/home/username".</p>
    <p style="color: white">2. ls - 2. ls — Use the "ls" command to know what files are in the directory you are in. You
        can see all the hidden files by using the command “ls -a”.</p>
    <p style="color: white">3. cd — Use the "cd" command to go to a directory. For example, if you are in the home
        folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you can type in “cd Downloads”. Remember, this command
        is case sensitive, and you have to type in the name of the folder exactly as it is. But there is a problem with
        these commands. Imagine you have a folder named “Raspberry Pi”. In this case, when you type in “cd Raspberry
        Pi”, the shell will take the second argument of the command as a different one, so you will get an error saying
        that the directory does not exist. Here, you can use a backward slash. That is, you can use “cd Raspberry\ Pi”
        in this case. Spaces are denoted like this: If you just type “cd” and press enter, it takes you to the home
        directory. To go back from a folder to the folder before that, you can type “cd ..” . The two dots represent
        back.</p>
    <p style="color: white">4. mkdir & rmdir — Use the mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory.
        For example, if you want to make a directory called “DIY”, then you can type “mkdir DIY”. Remember, as told before, if you want to
        create a directory named “DIY Hacking”, then you can type “mkdir DIY\ Hacking”. Use rmdir to delete a directory.
        But rmdir can only be used to delete an empty directory. To delete a directory containing files, use rm.</p>
    <p style="color: white"> 5. rm - Use the rm command to delete files and directories. Use "rm -r" to delete just the directory. It deletes
    both the folder and the files it contains when using only the rm command.</p>
    <p style="color: white"> 6. touch — The touch command is used to create a file. It can be anything, from an empty txt file to an empty
    zip file. For example, “touch new.txt”.</p>
    <p style="color: white"> 7. man & --help — To know more about a command and how to use it, use the man command. It shows the manual pages
    of the command. For example, “man cd” shows the manual pages of the cd command. Typing in the command name and
    the argument helps it show which ways the command can be used (e.g., cd –help).</p>
    <p style="color: white"> 8. cp — Use the cp command to copy files through the command line. It takes two arguments: The first is the
    location of the file to be copied, the second is where to copy.</p>
    <p style="color: white"> 9. mv — Use the mv command to move files through the command line. We can also use the mv command to rename a
    file. For example, if we want to rename the file “text” to “new”, we can use “mv text new”. It takes the two
    arguments, just like the cp command.</p>
    <p style="color: white"> 10. locate — The locate command is used to locate a file in a Linux system, just like the search command in
    Windows. This command is useful when you don't know where a file is saved or the actual name of the file. Using
    the -i argument with the command helps to ignore the case (it doesn't matter if it is uppercase or lowercase).
    So, if you want a file that has the word “hello”, it gives the list of all the files in your Linux system
    containing the word "hello" when you type in “locate -i hello”. If you remember two words, you can separate them
    using an asterisk (*). For example, to locate a file containing the words "hello" and "this", you can use the
    command “locate -i *hello*this”.</p>
